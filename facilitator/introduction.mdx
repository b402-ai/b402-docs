The **b402 Facilitator** is the official off-chain service that powers payment verification and settlement for the **b402 protocol**.  

It provides shared infrastructure for verifying signed payment payloads, executing on-chain settlements, and ensuring consistent behavior across networks and token schemes.  

By abstracting blockchain complexity, the facilitator offers a uniform API for developers and resource serversâ€”enabling better reliability, observability, and interoperability across multiple merchants and applications.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified verification and settlement:** Consistent handling of all supported schemes and networks.  
- **Reduced on-chain complexity:** Offload blockchain operations from individual servers.  
- **Multi-tenant design:** Serve multiple merchants or applications through a common `/verify` and `/settle` API.  
- **Service discovery:** Help clients identify compatible merchants via the `/list` endpoint.

## Facilitator Responsibilities

The facilitator is responsible for securely mediating between clients (buyers) and resource servers (sellers) while ensuring correct on-chain behavior.

- Expose secure `/verify` and `/settle` endpoints following **x402-compatible** request/response formats  
- Validate **Payment Payloads** according to scheme and network specifications  
- Prevent replay attacks and ensure **idempotent verification**  
- Submit verified transactions for **on-chain settlement** and monitor confirmations  
- Provide clear, structured error responses for failed verifications or settlements  
- Maintain reliable RPC and wallet infrastructure for supported networks  
- Implement **logging**, **metrics**, **rate limiting**, and **alerting** for operational robustness
