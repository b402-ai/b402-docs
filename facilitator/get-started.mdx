## ‚ö° Overview

The **B402 Facilitator** is the off-chain service that powers **gasless ERC-20 token transfers** on the BNB Chain.  
It bridges **off-chain signatures** and **on-chain execution**, allowing users and agents to transact without holding BNB for gas.

> **In short:**  
> **b402** is a **gasless payment protocol** that removes the need for users to hold BNB to make USDT or USDC transactions ‚Äî think of it as **meta-transactions for payments**.

### üß† Concept

1. **Users sign** a transaction authorization (EIP-712) ‚Äî no gas required.  
2. **Facilitators verify** the signature off-chain.  
3. **Facilitators relay** the transaction on-chain through the **B402Relayer** contract, paying gas on behalf of the user.  
4. **Transfers settle** on-chain instantly, and optionally the facilitator collects a small fee.

This architecture allows agents, users, and applications to interact programmatically without manual wallet confirmation or native gas.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Why It Matters

| Problem | Impact | Solution |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Users need BNB to pay gas | Prevents first-time users from transacting | Facilitator pays gas on behalf of the user |
| Legacy tokens (e.g., USDT on BSC) lack meta-tx support | Cannot use `permit()` or `transferWithAuthorization()` | **B402Relayer** adds EIP-3009-style authorization |
| High UX friction for AI agents | Agents can‚Äôt directly pay for API/data services | Gasless meta-transactions enable autonomous agent payments |
