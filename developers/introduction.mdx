Welcome to **b402 Developer Docs**.

Here you’ll learn how to set up buyer agents/clients and seller servers, turn HTTP requests into programmable payment flows, settle transactions on-chain, and create new economic models for agents, servers, and applications.

## Ecosystem Architecture

The **b402 ecosystem** is composed of three interconnected layers:

1. **Protocol Layer — b402 Protocol**  
   The open payment standard derived from HTTP 402. It defines how payment-required responses are structured, verified, and settled across on-chain networks.

2. **Service Layer — b402 Facilitator & b402Scan**  
   The operational backbone of the ecosystem.  
   - **Facilitator** handles verification and settlement of on-chain payments through standardized APIs.  
   - **b402Scan** serves as the discovery and onboarding platform for new servers and agents.

3. **Developer Experience Layer — SDKs**  
   Tools, SDKs, and client libraries that make it easy to integrate b402 into your agents, apps, or backend services with minimal setup.

## Developer Section Overview

In this section, you’ll find everything needed to build with b402:

- **Protocol Specs** — Core definitions, message formats, and settlement logic.  
- **Service APIs** — Endpoints for Facilitator and b402Scan integration.  
- **SDK Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides for using the b402 SDK to connect, pay, and verify transactions.  

Start building with **b402** — the simplest way to make your services payable, verifiable, and autonomous.
