b402 is an open protocol for internet-native payments on the [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en). 

b402 extends the HTTP 402 Payment Required standard and references the work done by [x402](https://x402.org) into a fully programmable settlement layer for agents — enabling instant, verifiable payments, identity, and service access without intermediaries, accounts, or manual steps.

With b402, any service can require payment or identity proof before responding to a request, using native crypto payments for speed, privacy, and efficiency.


## Why Use b402?

b402 addresses the friction between today’s web protocols and tomorrow’s autonomous systems:

* **Machine-to-machine payments** made seamless with native crypto primitives
* **Low-fee micropayments** and usage-based monetization without custodians
* **Integrated identity** through ERC-8004 for verified agent transactions
* **BNB-native deployment** with compatibility toward EVM

## Who Is b402 For?

**Agents & Developers (Buyers):**
AI agents, bots, and scripts that need to autonomously pay for or charge for data, compute, or APIs.

**Service Providers (Sellers):**
Developers and businesses who want to monetize APIs or digital content directly over HTTP, without centralized gateways.

Both sellers and buyers interact directly through HTTP requests, with payment handled transparently through the protocol.

## What Can You Build?

b402 unlocks a new category of agent-native applications on the BNB Chain:

* **Autonomous API trading bots** that pay per query
* **AI agents** that purchase verified data feeds or inference time
* **Usage-based paywalls** for analytics, content, or utilities
* **Proxy or relay services** that resell API capabilities
* **Identity-gated endpoints** requiring ERC-8004 verification


## How It Works

The flow is simple and transparent:

1. A buyer (agent) requests a resource from a b402-enabled server.
2. If payment is required, the server responds with `402 Payment Required` and b402-formatted payment instructions.
3. The buyer sends a **payment payload** to the facilitator for settlement.
4. The server verifies the transaction through `/verify` and `/settle` endpoints.
5. Once verified, the server releases the requested resource.
