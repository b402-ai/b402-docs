    <Tab title="General">
        <Accordion title='What is b402 in a single sentence?'>
            b402 is an open, on-chain payment standard that extends the dormant HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code into a programmable settlement layer for AI agents and web services on the BNB Chain.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Is b402 a Binance product?'>
            No. b402 is an **open protocol** built on BNB Chain, governed by an open-source specification under the Apache-2.0 license.  
            Binance and other ecosystem contributors may operate facilitators, but no single entity controls the protocol.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Why not use traditional payment rails or API keys?'>
            Traditional systems rely on centralized processors, accounts, and manual flows.  
            b402 removes those barriers — enabling **machine-to-machine, HTTP-native payments** that settle instantly on-chain with minimal fees.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Is b402 only for crypto-native projects?'>
            No. Any service — from API providers to AI agents to websites — can integrate b402 to enable programmatic, per-request or usage-based payments.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Language & Frameworks">
        <Accordion title='Which languages and frameworks are supported?'>
            The b402 reference implementations are written in **TypeScript** and **Python**, but the protocol is open and language-agnostic.  
            Anyone can implement it in Go, Rust, or any environment that supports HTTP requests and ECDSA/EIP-712 signing.  
            Developers are encouraged to open PRs or RFCs in the GitHub repository to expand SDK coverage.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Facilitators">
        <Accordion title='Who operates facilitators?'>
            b402 is permissionless — anyone can deploy and operate a facilitator.  
            The **b402 Reference Facilitator** runs on BNB mainnet and testnet, and community facilitators extend support to Base, Polygon, and other EVM networks.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='What prevents a malicious facilitator from stealing funds?'>
            Each payment payload is **signed by the buyer** and **settled directly on-chain**.  
            A facilitator that tampers with a payload fails cryptographic verification.  
            b402 is a **non-custodial** protocol — facilitators never hold funds.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Pricing & Schemes">
        <Accordion title='How should I price my endpoint or API?'>
            Common pricing models include:
            1. **Flat per-call** — fixed fee per request (e.g., `$0.001`).
            2. **Tiered** — different prices for `/basic` vs `/pro` routes.
            3. **Up-to** — pay-as-you-go pricing that adjusts with usage (under development).
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Can I integrate b402 with existing usage meters or subscription systems?'>
            Yes. b402 handles the **payment execution**, not usage tracking.  
            You can still use existing metering tools or subscription logic (like Metronome or custom CRON billing) and trigger b402 payments when thresholds are reached.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Networks & Tokens">
        <Accordion title='Which networks and tokens are supported today?'>
            | Network | Tokens | Fees | Status |
            | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------- |
            | BNB Chain | BNB, USDT, USDC | Near-zero | **Mainnet** |
            | BNB Testnet | Test tokens | None | **Testnet** |
            | Polygon | USDC, USDT | Minimal | **Community** |
            | Base | USDC | Minimal | **Community** |

            *Gas is paid on-chain; facilitators do not add extra fees.*  
            Support for additional EVM and LayerZero networks is expanding.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Does b402 support fiat on- or off-ramps?'>
            Not natively.  
            However, facilitators or third-party gateways can integrate fiat payment bridges for deposits or withdrawals if required.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Security">
        <Accordion title='Do I need to expose my private key to the backend?'>
            No.  
            Agents or buyers **sign locally** in their runtime environment (browser, VM, or enclave).  
            Servers and facilitators only verify signatures — they never have access to private keys.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='How are refunds handled?'>
            b402 currently supports **push-style payments** — once settled, they’re final.  
            Refunds are handled at the business-logic level by sending a new transaction back to the buyer.  
            Future “conditional” or **escrow schemes** may introduce reversible or time-locked transfers.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Agents & Automation">
        <Accordion title='How do AI agents know what to pay?'>
            Agents follow the same 402 lifecycle:
            1. Request the resource.  
            2. Receive `402 Payment Required` with structured payment options.  
            3. Select a scheme and sign a payload via the b402 SDK.  
            4. Resubmit with the `X-PAYMENT` header.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='Do agents need wallets?'>
            Yes. Each agent must have a **programmable wallet** capable of signing EIP-712 payloads.  
            Wallets can be EOAs, smart wallets (EIP-1271), or ERC-8004 agent identities.  
            Libraries like **viem**, **ethers-v6**, or the **b402 SDK** simplify this setup.
        </Accordion>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Governance & Roadmap">
        <Accordion title='Is there a formal specification or whitepaper?'>
            * **Specification:** [GitHub Spec Repository](https://github.com/b402/specs)  
            * **Whitepaper:** [b402.org Whitepaper](https://b402.org/whitepaper.pdf)  
            * **License:** Apache-2.0, fully open standard.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title='How will b402 evolve?'>
            b402 development is public and community-driven.  
            Upcoming priorities include:
            * Expanded facilitator network (BNB, LayerZero, SVM)  
            * Multi-token and cross-chain support  
            * ERC-8004-based identity verification  
            * Standardized trust and reputation layer for agents
