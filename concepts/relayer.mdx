The **b402 Relayer** is the on-chain smart contract that enables gasless BEP-20 payments on the BNB Chain.  

It works in tandem with the Facilitator service, verifying off-chain signatures and executing authorized token transfers on behalf of users.

Beyond gasless execution, the Relayer supports **multiple tokens within the BNB Chain ecosystem**, allowing agents and applications to send and receive payments in custom BEP-20 assets.

<Note>
The b402 Relayer contract is currently **unaudited** and **not intended for production use**. It should only be deployed in testing or development environments.

## Key Capabilities

The **b402 Relayer** serves as a meta-transaction executor for tokens that do not natively implement EIP-3009 or `permit()` functionality.  

It allows a facilitator to submit a signed authorization from a user and pay the associated gas cost to execute the transfer on-chain.

This design enables off-chain payment authorization, ideal for agents, automated clients, or users without BNB for gas.

**Features:**
- Executes gasless BEP-20 or ERC-20 transfers (e.g., USDT, USDC, BUSD)  
- Verifies **EIP-712** signatures for authenticity  
- Prevents replay attacks using nonces  
- Enforces validity windows (`validAfter`, `validBefore`)  
- Supports **token whitelisting** for enhanced security  
- Compatible with all **standard EVM tokens** on BNB Chain

## How It Works

1. **User signs off-chain authorization**  
   The user (or agent) signs an **EIP-712 message** authorizing a specific token transfer.  
   Example message:  
   > “I authorize the transfer of 1 USDT from my address to the recipient.”

2. **Facilitator verifies and relays on-chain**  
   The facilitator validates the user’s signature locally.  
   If valid, it calls the `transferWithAuthorization()` function on the Relayer contract and **pays the gas** for execution.

3. **Contract executes the transfer**  
   The Relayer verifies the signature, ensures nonce and time constraints are met, and then calls the token contract’s `transferFrom()` function on behalf of the user.
