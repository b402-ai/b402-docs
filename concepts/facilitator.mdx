# Facilitator

This page explains the role of the **facilitator** in the **b402** protocol.

In b402, the facilitator is a trust-minimized service that handles the **verification and settlement** of payments between agents (clients) and service providers (servers).  
It serves as the connective tissue between **HTTP-level requests** and **on-chain execution**.

---

### What is a Facilitator?

A **facilitator** is an independent service that:

* **Verifies** the validity of payment payloads submitted by clients.  
* **Settles** payments or identity proofs on-chain on behalf of servers.  

By using a facilitator, servers can accept crypto-native payments without needing direct blockchain infrastructure or custom verification logic.  
This design keeps b402 integrations light, fast, and modular.

### Facilitator Responsibilities

* **Verify payments:** Confirm that the client’s submitted payload satisfies the server’s declared payment terms.  
* **Settle transactions:** Post valid transactions to the blockchain and monitor for confirmation.  
* **Provide signed responses:** Return structured verification and settlement responses that the server can use to authorize access.  

> The facilitator never holds user funds or keys.  
> It simply verifies signatures, executes transactions, and returns proofs of settlement.

### Why Use a Facilitator?

Using a facilitator simplifies the integration process for service providers and ensures protocol-level consistency:

* **Reduced complexity** — No need to maintain blockchain nodes or custom verification code.  
* **Standardized flows** — Shared verification and settlement semantics across all b402 integrations.  
* **Faster onboarding** — Start accepting payments instantly without blockchain-specific logic.  
* **Scalable trust model** — Facilitators can be public, private, or self-hosted, depending on your architecture.  

While verification can be implemented locally, using a facilitator provides uniform behavior across the network and simplifies adoption.

### Live Facilitators

1. **BNB Chain Reference Facilitator** — The canonical b402 facilitator running on BNB mainnet and testnet, supporting BNB and standard BEP-20 tokens.  

2. **Community Facilitators** — Partners and operators can deploy their own facilitators to serve specialized networks (e.g., LayerZero bridges, EVM sidechains).  

More facilitator endpoints and documentation will be listed here as the ecosystem expands.

### Interaction Flow

Below is the typical end-to-end process for verification and settlement in **b402**:

1. **Client (agent)** sends an HTTP request to a b402-enabled resource server.  
2. **Server** responds with `402 Payment Required`, including structured payment details (amount, token, recipient, scheme).  
3. **Client** constructs a signed payment payload according to the chosen scheme.  
4. **Client** resends the request with an `X-PAYMENT` header containing the payload.  
5. **Server** forwards the payload and payment details to the **facilitator** via the `/verify` endpoint.  
6. **Facilitator** validates the payload using the specified scheme and network parameters.  
7. **Facilitator** returns a verification response (`valid` or `invalid`) to the server.  
8. **Server**, upon valid verification, fulfills the request and optionally calls `/settle` to finalize payment.  
9. **Facilitator** executes the on-chain settlement transaction and waits for confirmation.  
10. **Facilitator** returns a `Payment Execution Response` containing settlement metadata.  
11. **Server** returns `200 OK` with the requested resource and an `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing encoded settlement data.  

This process allows every transaction to be **atomic**, **verifiable**, and **composable** with other on-chain systems.

### Summary

In **b402**, the facilitator acts as the **verification and execution layer** connecting the web and the blockchain.  
It ensures that payments, signatures, and identity proofs are handled securely, allowing services to remain **stateless**, **modular**, and **agent-ready**.

The facilitator turns HTTP 402 from a signal into an action — verifying, settling, and confirming payments for the autonomous web.
