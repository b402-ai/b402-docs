# Network & Token Support

This page explains which blockchain networks and tokens are supported by **b402**, and how developers can extend support to new networks.

---

## Overview

**b402** is designed to be **network-agnostic**, but **facilitators** implement the network-specific logic required for on-chain verification and settlement.  
This modular structure allows b402 to function across any EVM-compatible chain — starting with **BNB Chain** as the primary network.

Different facilitators may support different networks depending on their on-chain integrations and token standards.

---

### Supported Facilitators

Network support in **b402** depends on the facilitator being used. Below are the currently available and planned facilitators.

#### b402 Reference Facilitator

* **Supports**: BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet & Testnet)
* **Notes**: Default facilitator in the b402 SDK. Ideal for testing and quick integration.
* **URL**: <https://facilitator.b402.org>

#### Community Facilitators

* **Supports**: BNB, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and other EVM-compatible networks
* **Notes**: Operated by community partners and integrators. Support for additional tokens and LayerZero cross-chain proofs in progress.

#### Self-Hosted Facilitators

* **Supports**: Any EVM network
* **Notes**: Run your own facilitator for full control, privacy, and customization. Suitable for high-throughput or private deployments.
* **Setup**: See [Adding Support for New Networks](#adding-support-for-new-networks) for configuration details.

### Token Support

b402 supports **any EVM-compatible token** that implements **permit-style authorization** — such as EIP-2612 or EIP-3009 — enabling off-chain, gasless approvals verified by facilitators.

* **EVM (BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.):**  
  Any ERC-20 token supporting `permit` or `transferWithAuthorization`.  
* **BNB Native Support:**  
  Built-in support for BNB and major BEP-20 tokens, including stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.

> Facilitators enforce **network-level support**, not token-level allowlists.  
> Any compatible ERC-20/BEP-20 token can be used if its permit signature can be verified.

---

#### Permit & Authorization Standards

To ensure seamless integration and gas abstraction, supported tokens must implement one of the following:

* **EIP-2612 `permit()`** — Enables off-chain approvals without sending on-chain approvals.  
* **EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization()`** — Allows direct off-chain authorization and gasless transfers.  
* **BEP-20 Permit Extensions** — Native support for signature-based authorization on BNB Chain.

These standards allow b402 to settle payments directly from signed payloads, enabling **instant, agent-native transactions**.

### Specifying Payment Amounts

When configuring payment requirements in a b402-enabled server, you can specify:

1. **Price String** — e.g., `"$0.01"` (defaults to USDC).  
2. **TokenAmount Object** — Explicitly define the amount and token metadata.  

Example:

```typescript
{
  tokenAmount: {
    token: "0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955", // USDT on BNB Chain
    amount: "1000000", // 1 USDT in atomic units
    eip712: {
      name: "Tether USD",
      version: "1"
    }
  }
}
