# Wallet

This page explains the role of the **wallet** in the **b402** protocol.

In **b402**, a wallet functions as both a **payment interface** and a **cryptographic identity** for agents, buyers, and service providers.  
It authorizes payments, verifies identity, and serves as the anchor of trust between clients and servers in every 402 exchange.

---

### Role of the Wallet

#### For Agents (Buyers)

Agent wallets are used to:

* **Hold tokens** — such as BNB, USDT, or USDC for on-chain payments.  
* **Sign payment payloads** — cryptographically authorize transfers or proofs via `permit()` or `transferWithAuthorization()`.  
* **Establish identity** — bind ERC-8004 agent credentials to a verified on-chain address.  
* **Automate payments** — enable autonomous agents to pay for API calls or data access programmatically.  

With b402, agents can transact directly over HTTP — no accounts, credentials, or session management required.

---

#### For Services (Sellers)

Service provider wallets are used to:

* **Receive payments** — define the on-chain destination for settlements in their server configuration.  
* **Authenticate responses** — optionally sign responses or attach proof of ownership.  
* **Integrate with facilitators** — register destination addresses for verified settlements and receipts.  

A seller’s wallet address is included in the `402 Payment Required` response so that clients know exactly where to direct payments.

### Identity Layer

In b402, wallets extend beyond payment — they represent **verifiable, programmable identities** through the [ERC-8004 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004).  
This standard allows agents and services to:

* **Mint and verify unique identities** on-chain  
* **Sign requests with reputation-linked addresses**  
* **Enable delegation**, allowing one wallet to act on behalf of another  

This makes b402 not just a payment protocol, but a **trust fabric for machine-to-machine commerce**.

### Supported Wallet Types

| Wallet Type            | Compatibility          | Use Case                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| EOA (Externally Owned)  | ✅ All EVM networks     | Simple agent or service wallet             |
| Smart Contract Wallet   | ✅ (EIP-1271)           | Multi-signature or programmable agent      |
| ERC-8004 Identity       | ✅ (BNB, EVM)           | Verified on-chain identity for agents      |
| Custodial Wallets       | ⚙️ Optional integration | Exchange or enterprise-level accounts      |

Developers can use standard EVM-compatible wallets such as **MetaMask**, **Safe**, or **Rainbow**, or integrate with custom agent wallets via the b402 SDK.

### Best Practices

* Always **store private keys securely**, preferably in HSMs or encrypted agent environments.  
* Use **dedicated wallets per agent** for clearer tracking and reduced key risk.  
* For service operators, use **separate wallets** for revenue collection and facilitator settlement.  
* For automated agents, implement **periodic rotation or delegation** through ERC-8004 credentials.  

---

### Summary

* Wallets in **b402** act as both **payment endpoints** and **verifiable identities**.  
* Agents (buyers) use wallets to authorize and settle payments programmatically.  
* Services (sellers) use wallets to define where payments are received.  
* ERC-8004 expands wallets into **programmable agent identities**, enabling a trust layer for the autonomous web.
