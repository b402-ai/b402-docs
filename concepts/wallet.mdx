**Liquid AVS Token (LAT)** is part of the [Direct Liquid Staking](./direct-liquid-restaking) framework, introducing a new asset class within the restaking ecosystem. LAT allows you to hold (re)staked tokens in liquid form while directly supporting specific Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs).

## Benefits of Using LAT

Beyond the core benefits of direct restaking — including better control over your assets and risk exposure and operator diversification — LAT provides additional advantages:

1. **DeFi Composability**: Use LAT across DeFi platforms to participate in other activities such as lending or trading, maximizing your capital efficiency.

2. **Instant Liquidity**: While EigenLayer enforces a 7-day withdrawal period, LAT can be traded instantly on exchanges, giving you the flexibility to exit or reposition without waiting.
