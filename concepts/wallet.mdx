In **b402**, a wallet functions as both a payment interface and a cryptographic identity for agents, buyers, and service providers.

It authorizes payments, verifies identity, and serves as the anchor of trust between clients and servers in every b402 exchange.

## Role of the Wallet

### For Agents (Buyers)

Agent wallets are used to:

- **Hold tokens** — such as BNB, USDT, or USDC for on-chain payments.  
- **Sign payment payloads** — cryptographically authorize transfers or proofs via `permit()` or `transferWithAuthorization()`.  
- **Establish identity** — bind ERC-8004 agent credentials to a verified on-chain address.  
- **Automate payments** — enable autonomous agents to pay for API calls or data access programmatically.  

### For Services (Sellers)

Service provider wallets are used to:

- **Receive payments** — define the on-chain destination for settlements in their server configuration.  
- **Authenticate responses** — optionally sign responses or attach proof of ownership.  
- **Integrate with facilitators** — register destination addresses for verified settlements and receipts.  

A seller’s wallet address is included in the `402 Payment Required` response so that clients know exactly where to direct payments.

## Identity Layer

In b402, wallets extend beyond payment. They represent verifiable, programmable identities through the [ERC-8004 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004).  

This standard allows agents and services to:
- **Mint and verify unique identities** on-chain  
- **Sign requests with reputation-linked addresses**  
- **Enable delegation**, allowing one wallet to act on behalf of another  

This makes b402 not just a payment protocol, but a trust fabric for machine-to-machine commerce.
