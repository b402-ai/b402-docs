Area organizes assets into base asset groups to simplify the user experience and optimize yield generation.

A base asset group includes a primary token and its liquid derivatives â€” for example, ETH and ETH-based Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), or BTC and its wrapped versions like WBTC.

When you restake your tokens, Area pools assets within the same base group together. This allows the protocol to efficiently swap between these correlated assets to maximize your yield.

At the time of withdrawal, your assets will be swapped back into the original token you deposited.
