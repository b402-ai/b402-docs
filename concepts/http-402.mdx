# HTTP 402

For decades, the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code sat unused — a placeholder for the internet’s missing native payment layer.  
**b402** activates it, extending its semantics into a programmable settlement layer for **agents** on the BNB Chain.

### What is HTTP 402?

[HTTP 402](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.2) is a standard, though rarely implemented, HTTP response code indicating that **payment is required** to access a resource.

In **b402**, this code becomes a living bridge between the web and on-chain payments. When a client (human or agent) requests a resource:

* The server responds with `402 Payment Required` if payment or identity verification is needed.  
* The response includes structured payment instructions — such as amount, token, and destination address.  
* The client can then complete the payment or verification programmatically, without accounts or intermediaries.

### Why b402 Uses HTTP 402

**b402** redefines HTTP 402 as the missing primitive for **agent-to-service commerce**.  
It enables frictionless, verifiable payments directly over HTTP for:

* **Machine-to-machine (M2M)** interactions, such as AI agents and automated scripts.  
* **Usage-based access**, including APIs, compute units, or paywalled data.  
* **Microtransactions** settled instantly on-chain with BNB or supported tokens.  
* **Identity-gated requests**, verified through ERC-8004 identities.

By embedding payment and verification directly within the HTTP layer, **b402** keeps the protocol **web-native**, **crypto-secure**, and **developer-friendly**.
